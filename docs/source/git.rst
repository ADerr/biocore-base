All code should be committed to version control from inception.
This is a critical part of managing development and regression, and makes it
much easier to share and collaborate - now or in the future.
We recommend `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_. Free hosting is available on `github
<http://www.github.com>`_ for open source projects and `bitbucket
<http://www.bitbucket.org>`_ for private ones.

Branching
=========

You may find that a specific branching process and release strategy becomes
more critical as your project's code base and contributor base grows bigger.
Pick one (`git flow branching <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>`_ is
recommended) and document that choice in your source.
